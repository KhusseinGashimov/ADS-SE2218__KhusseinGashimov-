Laboratory-1 tasks. In this assignment I've solved 10 tasks using recursion algorithms. 
I wrote my code on JAVA using IntelliJ IDEA. In my project you can read different comments based on algorithms and other things. I did a lot of tests for every program to avoid mistakes. 
Note: Almost every algorithm in my code is my own way to solving the problem.
